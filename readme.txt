I utilized the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to systematically explore and traverse the possibilities of guessing the name of the team. By employing BFS, I iteratively examined each potential letter choice, starting with the most promising options nearest to the initial state and gradually expanding outward. This methodical approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the solution space, enabling me to efficiently deduce and ascertain the correct name of the team.
